    "Intensity Transformation Operations are applied to images primarily to enhance visual appearance or to prepare the image for further analysis (like segmentation or feature extraction). Here's a breakdown of why we do it:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 1. Image Enhancement\n",
    "To improve contrast or brightness so details are easier to see.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Making a dark image brighter to reveal hidden objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 2. Highlighting or Suppressing Features\n",
    "Emphasize certain pixel intensity ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppress irrelevant details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: In medical imaging, enhancing soft tissues while suppressing bones.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 3. Normalization or Standardization\n",
    "Adjust intensity values to a standard range (e.g., 0–255).\n",
    "\n",
    "Useful for consistent analysis or model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 4. Noise Reduction or Contrast Stretching\n",
    "Remove extreme brightness/darkness artifacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stretch low-contrast images to use full dynamic range.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 5. Preparation for Thresholding or Segmentation\n",
    "Make object-background separation easier by enhancing pixel values.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 6. Non-linear Mapping for Better Perception\n",
    "Human vision perceives brightness non-linearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use operations like:\n",
    "\n",
    "Log transformation – enhances dark regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gamma correction – adjusts brightness in a perceptually uniform way.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 7. Dynamic Range Compression\n",
    "Useful in scenes with very high brightness variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Log or gamma transformations compress wide ranges into visible range."

Here, s is the output intensity, r\\>=0 is the input intensity of the pixel, and c is a scaling constant. c is given by `255/(log (1 + m))`, where m is the maximum pixel value in the image. It is done to ensure that the final pixel value does not exceed (L-1), or 255. Practically, log transformation maps a narrow range of low-intensity input values to a wide range of output values.
